[Scene 1]

Panel 1 - Park, daytime. No one is visible in frame.

	NeighthanNarrator: Boy, this sure is a beautiful day.
	NN: If only I had someone to share it with...
	LH: Hello, Neighthan.

Panel 2 - A sexy lady horse (LH) appears in the frame.
	
	Neighthan: (shocked at this new appearance) Well, hello. It's great to see you.
	LH: It's been a while, hasn't it Neighthan?
	N: (sadly) Yes... almost too long.

Panel 2 - LH's appearance starts to change and warp slightly. This continues throughout the next few frames until it become clear that Neighthan is in a dream
	
	LH: Well, it's been hard to think of you since you...
	LH: (sadly) ...broke my heart.
	N: (shocked) What! I've never broken anyone's heart!

Panel 3 - LH's eyes start to fall off of her face, not in a gross eye-sockety way, but in a weird Dali-ish way

	LH: Don't be ridiculous, Neighthan. You know what you did to me. You know you broke my heart.
	N: (unsettled) What... what is wrong with your face?

Panel 4 - LH's skin starts to slough her skin from her skeleton. There is no visible muscle, just skeleton.

	LH: Neighthan! You jerk, nothing is wrong with my face!
	N: (really freaking out) No... your skin!
	LH: My skin is flawless!

Panel 5 - LH is only a skeleton, standing before Neighthan

	N: AHHHH

[Scene 2]

Panel 1 - Neighthan awakes with a start to a completely black room.

	NN: Ah shit! It was a dream!

Panel 2 - Neighthan turns on a lamp. Light fills the room to reveal a cramped apartment bedroom containing not much more than a bed, a desk with a shitty laptop on it, and a few books stacked in a corner. The walls are bare and boring. This is the room of a deeply depressed horse.

	NN: Fuuuccckkk... I need a pick me up

Panel 3 - Neighthan reaches for his bottle of Vicodin, only to discover that there's only three pills left.

	NN: Shit, almost out of pills. I need to get some more today. Need to call Hyperion.
	NN: (scrambling)
	NN: WHERE THE FUCK IS MY PHONE

Panel 4 - Neighthan goes out to his apartment's common area, a room just as gross as his bedroom, although slightly better furnished. His roommate, Tony, is sitting on the couch, watching a TV showing only the Muybridge run cycle on loop.

	N: Hey Tony, have you seen my phone?
	Tony: Nah, man. You need to borrow mine?
	N: Yeah, thanks.

Panel 5 - Neighthan goes back into his room to call Hyperion, his drug dealer that only refers to himself in the third person.

	NN: C'mon, pick up.
	Hyperion: (over the phone) Speak
	N: Hyperion, it's Neighthan
	H: Hey, my man. What can Hyperion do for you?
	N: I need some more pills.
	H: Oof, Hyperion's running a little short right now, but Hyperion will see what he can do. When do you need them?

Panel 6a - Neighthan must decide when he needs his pills

	N: (Today) Today. I need them today. I'm almost out.
	H: That's gonna cost you. Hyperion has to go through a lot of trouble to get more today, ya dig?
	N: How much extra?
	H: $6 per

Panel 7a - Neighthan looks in his wallet to see how much he has.
	N: I've only got enough for half a bottle.
	H: Well, Hyperion can get you half today and the rest later.
	N: I...
	N: I guess that works
	H: Aight, meet Hyperion at the park in two hours. Don't be late.

Panel 8a - Hyperion hangs up
	reconverge at panel 9

Panel 6b - Neighthan decides to wait
	N: (Tomorrow) I can wait until tomorrow, I've got a bit left.
	H: Aight, Hyperion will get you some for tomorrow. Regular price, you got enough?

Panel 7b - Neighthan checks his wallet to see how much he has
	N: Yeah, get me a full bottle. I'll see you tomorrow?
	H: Noon at the park. Don't be late.

Panel 8b - Hyperion hangs up
	reconverge at panel 9

Panel 9 - Neighthan goes back out into the living to give Tony his phone back.
	N: (as he tosses the phone at Tony) Thanks
	T: Yeah, man.

Panel 10 - Neighthan goes back to his room to search for his phone.
	NN: Now, where is my phone?
	(fade to black)

[Scene 3 - get pills today]

Panel 1 - Neighthan is at the park (same as in dream) waiting for Hyperion to show.
	NN: Where the fuck is he?
	NN: He makes such a big deal about being late, and then he's late.

Panel 2 - Neighthan looks at his Horse Phone (which I guess he found at some point, that dipshit) which shows a time of 12:35pm
	NN: If I didn't need the pills so badly I'd just go.
	NN: This is bullshit.
	(wait a few seconds)
	NN: Fuck it, I'm leaving.
	H: Neight! Where you goin?

Panel 3 - Hyperion appears in frame
	N: Oh... h-hey Hyperion. What's, uh... what's up, my ninja?
	H: Yeah, yeah. It's good. You got the money?
	N: Oh, yeah. Of course. Right here.

Panel 4 - Neight pulls out his wallet and hands the money to Hyperion. Hyperion takes the money and gives Neight an unmarked pill bottle.
	H: (counting the money) ...alright, we're done here. Hyperion'll see you around.
	N: Uh, yeah. Thanks, man.
	H: Whatever.
