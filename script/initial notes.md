# Horse Quest 2013: The Quest of a Lifetime
## Gameplay notes
* Timed responses like Walking Dead (because social anxiety)
	* Normal mode waits for user to finish reading before starting timer / showing responses
	* Hard mode does not / automatically flashes past text when after timer

* Lots of options, but few conversation trees. Mostly used to change Ladyhorse's opinion of Horse.
* Fart meter
	* need I say more?
	* The game gets harder (faster rising fart meter) based on what Stag orders for his meal
* Occasionally, all of Horse's dialog choices are awful because he is super social awkward and maybe autistic
